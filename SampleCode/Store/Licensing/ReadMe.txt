This app shows how to check if your application is licensed from the Google Play store.  This sample app will not work correctly unless it is built and uploaded to the google play store, although you don't have to publish it.  You also have to put in your own key into the config.lua file.  It might take the play store a few hours to register your uploaded app.  During this time you will get a "Not market managed" error.
